Blocks ads and redirects from a list of adult websites known to contain advertisements, banners, tracking, etc...
If you would like a site or advertising network added, please create an 'Issue' and I will get it added.

The goal of this project is to block ads, redirects, tracking, etc while not breaking the video playback. Please let me know if you encounter any errors with this hosts file. Happy to problem solve / fix them.
If you use Pi-Hole, there is a similar project that will aid with this hosts file: https://github.com/thisisu/pihole-regex . I use / maintain both of these and would recommend using them together.
It covers a lot of the redundancy you may find here as a lot of these contain a similar pattern / keywords. e.g. ads., banners., tds., etc...

The list below is what's covered. You can also consider this a harvesting grounds for bad/unwanted links to add to your own block lists

In order to use this hosts file, you should first back up your existing one located at : <b>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc</b>

Now download the "hosts" file within this branch and paste it into: <b>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc</b>

Afterwards, you should flush your DNS settings by opening a command prompt window: <b>Windows key</b> + <b>r</b> ==> <b>cmd</b> ==> ENTER

Type the following into the command line window: <b>ipconfig /flushdns</b>

You should now be set for a safer browser experience.
